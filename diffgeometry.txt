108,curvature is deviation from a line and torsion is deviation from curve being in plane,implication,32,108,,deviation|line|plane,curvature is deviation from a line and torsion is deviationn from curve being in plane. 
109,asymptotic curve,definition,1|24,|110,|110,unit speed|curve|asymptotic curve|a''.U = 0|k = 0,a unit speed curve on a surface a(t) is said to be an asymptotic curve if a''.U = 0 for each point on the curve. 
110,asymptotic curve is line in plane of unit normal and velocity vector,implication,109|24|31|55|58,,109,asymptotic curve|line|plane,this is a line since a''.U = S(a').a' = k(a') = k intersection curve for the  curve in the plane of the unit normal and velocity vector. 
111,any ruled minimal surface in R3 is part of a plane or a helicoid,Theorem 4.2.6 or Catalan's Theorem,77|85|88|81|6|7|10|26|24|30|32|108,,,ruled|minimal|plane|helicoid,Any ruled minimal surface in R3 is part of a plane or a helicoid. This is Catalan's Theorem. 
112,if M is area minimizing then M is minimal,Theorem 4.3.4,106|1|107,,105,area minimizing|minimal,if M is area minimizing then M is minimal 
113,immersed,definition,39|41,,,immersed|self interaction|tangent plane|one to one,immersed means we allow self interactions but the map on tangent planes is still one to one.
